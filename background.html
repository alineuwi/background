      <p>Foundation: Beyond your skincare routine, foundation is what makes your skin appear flawless; it evens out your skin tone and conceals any subtle blemishes or discolorations on your face. The most important aspect of foundation to consider is coverage. Generally speaking, there are two ways to go. If you want lighter coverage then opt for a tinted moisturizer, a slightly colored cream that you can swipe on with your fingers to give your skin a wash of color. This is the lazy girl’s M.O. If you’re interested in more coverage then liquid foundation — the classic form of foundation — is your best bet. This foundation is best applied with either your fingers, a flat synthetic foundation brush or a sponge blender.</p>
