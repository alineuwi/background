          <div id="hobbies">
           <h2>Hobbies</h2>
           <p>Some of my hobies include makeup design. In fact from my childhood i liked design,i used to draw and to shape every thing.
             When i became a tenager i started focusing on making up my face and my fellow collegues. I became a super star at school and
             I could tell they liked the way I do make-up. My friends came up with a slogan that said "my talent my business" and through
             this i started a business from my talent when i finished my university and it was in 2017.
             so, after that the problem was to found a proffessional name and makeup tools. Because the capital was my talent and remember
             to do that it reguires some of Ps of marketting 
             ( place,price,product and promotion).I remember at the beggining I started the game with my classemates, i.e there was a kind of marketting because
             at school is where you meet many people from different place.Here already promotion have started
             then about product there it was services it means that when i offered good services to that classmate, already second 
             Ps had applied as well as the third. And vice versa .. Then after about price would be varied according to what kind of 
             makeup a client wants
             And is where the first name like you want makeup comes from. so, as the time goes on the name have been 
             changed to "Look so beatful makeup."
             Below is an image of what I do;</p>
